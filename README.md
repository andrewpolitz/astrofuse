The purpose of this project is to explore the design and feasibility of a hybrid fission-fusion nuclear thermal propulsion system for space applications. By integrating a subcritical fission blanket with a fusion neutron source, the system aims to enhance safety, efficiency, and performance compared to traditional nuclear thermal propulsion designs.
